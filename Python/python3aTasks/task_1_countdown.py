# A for loop to run the indented code block 10 times
# The variable 'i' is used as a placeholder because its better than using _ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
# use the loop counter's value, we just need to repeat the action
for i in range(10):
    # Print the message "Blast off!" on a new line each time
    print("Blast off!")
